# 0xdpslabs Website

Static website for 0xdpslabs — a personal lab for building developer tools and infrastructure.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Structure

- `/src/pages/` - Pages (index, philosophy, about)
- `/src/layouts/` - Base layout
- `/public/styles/` - Global CSS

## Deployment

Build output is in `dist/` after running `npm run build`. Deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

## Philosophy

This site is finished by default. No constant tweaks, no redesigns, no "improved messaging".  
If it doesn't change for 6 months, that's a success.
