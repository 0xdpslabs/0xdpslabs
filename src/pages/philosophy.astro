  </p>
  
  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-style: italic; color: var(--color-text);">

  </p>
  
  <p>
    This lab exists to explore systems design, developer experience,<br />
    and infrastructure patterns through real, working software.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is no fixed roadmap.<br />
    Projects evolve based on use, curiosity, and constraints.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Some ideas graduate into products.<br />
    Some remain experiments.<br />
    That's intentional.
  </p>
